    <p>Ash's original team was one of his most iconic, but it has its issues. Most glaringly, its strongest member
        (Charizard)
        didn't obey Ash once it reached its first Charmeleon evolution, which made it unreliable and greatly contributed
        to
        Ash's early league defeat (he only made the top 16). Ash was also a rookie at this point, with less experience
        and
        maturity under his belt.

        Plus, Ash didn't replace Butterfree with a full-time member after he released it, only occasionally swapping in
        others
        like Muk and Kingler, and many of his Pokémon never reached their final or secondary evolutions (and Pidgeotto
        only
        evolved right before Ash released it).</p>
